# Disentangled Image Colorization via Global Anchors

### Paper(coming soon) | [Project Page](https://menghanxia.github.io/projects/disco.html) | Online Demo(coming soon)

Conceptual, our colorization model consists of two components: (i) **anchor color representation** that predicts the global color anchors (i.e. location and probabilistic colors) as the color representation of the whole image; (ii) **anchor-guided color generation** that synthesizes the per-pixel colors deterministically by referring the specified anchor colors.
